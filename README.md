# Quality Administrator pursuing a career in data analysis.

I am a dedicated professional with a strong background in the quality field. Currently enhancing my skills through a data skills Bootcamp and pursuing a BSc in Data Science.
In my current position, I play a pivotal role in ensuring quality standards by inputting and analysing data sets and generating reports using Microsoft Excel.
Prior to my current role, I gained valuable experience as a Quality Control Inspector, where I honed my attention to detail and analytical skills. I contributed to maintaining product quality and optimising manufacturing processes by inspecting parts and creating comprehensive reports.
